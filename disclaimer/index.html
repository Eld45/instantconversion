ARE ONLY ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE THINK YOU COULD EARN. THERE IS NO
ASSURANCE YOU'LL DO AS WELL. IF YOU RELY UPON OUR FIGURES, YOU MUST
ACCEPT THE RISK OF NOT DOING AS WELL.
WHERE SPECIFIC INCOME FIGURES ARE USED, AND ATTRIBUTED TO AN

WHERE A SPECIFIC EARNINGS AMOUNT IS GIVEN, THE AMOUNT EARNED IS
BEFORE REFUNDS AND NON-PAYMENTS. IN OTHER WORDS, BECAUSE I EARNED IT
DOESN’T MEAN I’LL BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL OF IT, AS THERE WILL BE REFUNDS
AND NON-PAYMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE EARNINGS ARE ACTUAL EARNINGS
BEFORE REFUNDS AND NON-PAYMENTS AND THE METHODS ARE THE METHODS
I'VE USED TO MAKE THOSE EARNINGS, NOTHING PRESENTED SHOULD BE
INTERPRETED AS TYPICAL RESULTS OR THAT YOU CAN GET SIMILAR RESULTS OR
REPLICATE WHAT I HAVE DONE OR EARN ANY MONEY AT ALL.
